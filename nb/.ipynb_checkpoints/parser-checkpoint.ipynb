    "This module provides a set of functions to parse, execute, and validate SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) commands for a test platform.\n",
    "It supports reading and writing to registers and memory, as well as comparing read data against reference values using masks.\n",
    "The results of each operation are logged to both HTML and TXT result files for reporting and debugging purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main functionalities:\n",
    "    - Execute SPI commands parsed from a test file (REGRD, REGWR, MEMRD, MEMWR, MEMRDM, MEMWRM, REGCMP, MEMCMP).\n",
    "    - Perform SPI read and write transactions.\n",
    "    - Compare register and memory data with reference values and masks.\n",
    "    - Log all actions and results in a human-readable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intended usage:\n",
    "    - Used as part of an automated test platform for SPI devices.\n",
    "    - Functions are designed to be called with parsed command lines and maintain state between operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependencies:\n",
    "    - Assumes existence of SPI interface object (AxiQspi) and several helper functions for formatting, parsing, and messaging.\n",
    "    - Relies on global configuration variables for command codes and data formatting.\n",
